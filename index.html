          <p> 
           I have read so much about this man that I've started aiming to be like him one day,He was chosen as Zimbabwe's youngest-ever Businessman of the Year in 1990. He soon became a role model for other young African entrepreneurs through his vision and persistance.
          </p>
          <p> He won numerous national and international honors, including a place on Time magazine's list of the world's most promising young executives in 2002. Masiyiwa attributed his success in part to the ethical integrity he developed through the devotional practice of reading the Bible for an hour every morning.</p>
           <p>
          He served on the boards of such international development agencies as the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation. He and his wife Tsitsi also founded and funded a charitable trust that had provided scholarships for more than five thousand AIDS orphans as of 2003.</p>

         <p>" The most important part of your life is actually the ability to use words. Words define your life; words define your values. Words define your personality. You are no better than your words; you are no greater than your words. The character of your words is the character of your personality: watch your words.</p>

         
<p>No man ever got better than his or her words. Your life is the expression, the manifestation, the reflection, of your words. It does not take long to know who you are. All you have to do is talk for a few minutes; this is because your words locate you; they tell where you are at. . ."</p>
